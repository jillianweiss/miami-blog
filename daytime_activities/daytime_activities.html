          <h2>The Beach</h2>

            <p class="description">With average temperatures ranging from <a href="http://www.rssweather.com/climate/Florida/Miami/75">75 to 90 degrees year-round</a>, it’s no surprise that one of most common weekend activities for students at UM is going to the beach.</p>

              <p class="description">Key Biscayne is only about a 20-minute drive from campus. The water is calm and it’s a quiet environment for those students who need to relax.</p>

              </aside>

              <p class="description">There are much different vibes in South Beach, where music is always blasting, people are always rowdy, and you’re almost guaranteed to be approached by a club promoter inviting you to a party later that night. Traffic is inevitable in Miami, so South Beach-goers should give themselves about an hour to get from campus to the beach.</p>

              <p class="description">Sunset Place is literally walking distance from campus, but for those students who aren’t interested in a little exercise, there’s a shuttle that runs every few hours to the shops at Sunset Place. Here you can find stores like Victoria’s Secret, Forever 21, and Express. In addition to clothing stores, there’s a bunch of restaurants and even a bowling alley and arcade.</p>
