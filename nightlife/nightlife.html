      <h1>☀ Nightlife ☀</h1>

        <section id="nightlife">

          <p class="description">The University of Miami is notorious for being a work-hard, play-harder school because of the extensive options for nightlife. There’s something for every type of partier almost every night of the week.</p>

          <h2>South Beach</h2>

            <p class="description">Most people that don’t actually attend UM probably think that the only thing students do on weekends is go clubbing in South Beach. It’s the most obvious option for nightlife at UM due to the fame of Miami’s nightclubs. With famous djs playing almost every weekend and appearances by famous celebrities such as Justin Bieber or Kendall Jenner, South Beach is a mecca for anyone that is into loud electronic dance music, crowded dancefloors, and ridiculously expensive drinks. Unfortunately for students who aren’t 21 and don’t have a distant relative who knows a guy that knows another guy that knows the bouncer, the chances of getting into clubs like Basement, LIV, Story, Wall, Bodega or E11even are slim to none.</p>

          <h2>The Grove</h2>

            <p class="description">Much more casual than South Beach, the Grove (Coconut Grove) is UM’s version of “college bars.” Every Tuesday and Thursday, Tavern and Sandbar are packed with sweaty UM kids -- mostly involved in Greek life -- drinking flat beer and watered-down cocktails. Although this may not sound so appealing to anyone at all, it’s been said that, “The Grove is better than Disneyworld.” Students usually end their night stuffing their faces with a giant slice from New York Pizza. Nothing says COLLEGE like beer and pizza!</p>

          <h2>Frat Parties</h2>

            </aside>

            <p class="description">Greek life isn’t huge at Miami, being that there are only <a href="http://www.miami.edu/sa/index.php/dean_of_students/FraternitiesAndSororities/">about 2,500 students in a sorority or fraternity out of the 12,000 undergraduate students at UM</a>. However, frat parties at Miami are huge. Every girl at Miami has her favorite frats, and she probably goes to at least one frat party per week. Whether it be a pregame for the Grove, a party at an off-campus house, or a registered party at the on-campus frat house, fraternities at Miami go above and beyond with their themed parties.</p>
