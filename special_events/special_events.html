            <p class="description">Ultra Music Festival is probably the most anticipated event of the year. Students spend hundreds of dollars on their tickets in September and set a countdown on their phones for Ultra, which takes place in March at Bayfront Park in downtown Miami. It is a 3-day electronic dance music festival and it is probably the best weekend of many students’ lives. Whether students are interested in listening to all of the mainstream edm that is constantly played on the radio or they are interested in a more specific genre of edm, there are different stages and artists for everyone. UM students practically take over an entire section of the crowd at the main stage every year, so don’t let the hundreds of thousands of strangers sway you from experiencing Ultra at least once during your 4 years in Miami.</p>

            <p class="description">Art Basel is an international art fair that takes place in Miami on one weekend every December. It seems like everyone and their mother all of a sudden have an appreciation for art on this weekend. There are galleries, exhibits, and events all over Miami during Art Basel, but the main exhibition is at the Miami Beach Convention Center. Exhibits in the Convention Center range from paintings to sculptures to interactive experiences. Art Basel can either be an enlightening experience, or it can be a great opportunity to snap a few pictures of you staring at various displays of art to make it seem like you’re a lot more sophisticated than you actually are.</p>
