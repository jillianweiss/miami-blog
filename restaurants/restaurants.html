        <section id="restaurants">

          <p class="description">Let’s face it. The dining hall food gets really old, really fast. By their third month at the University of Miami, students begin to use fewer and fewer of their weekly swipes at the dining hall. When it’s time to start branching out and exploring some off-campus dining options (that aren’t Denny’s, Chipotle, or the Whole Foods hot bar), you should definitely check the following restaurants out.</p>

            <p class="description">Havana Harry’s is a favorite among students at UM. Right across the street from Merrick Park, Havana Harry’s is a great spot to explore Cuban culture without driving the extra 15 minutes to Little Havana. The menu is huge and the portions are even bigger.</p>

            <p class="description">Students craving anything from sushi to pad thai should consider eating at Moon Thai. Located right across US-1 from campus, Moon Thai is a real crowd pleaser. It is a japanese AND thai food restaurant with great food and affordable prices.</p>

          <h2>Lulu in the Grove</h2>

            <aside>

            <p class="description">Sunday afternoons are considered holidays at the University of Miami. Students flock in packs to a number of restaurants serving brunch with bottomless mimosas. Although brunch at Zuma is probably the best, it’s also the most expensive and unnecessarily far. Brunch at Lulu in the Grove is another option. Located in Coconut Grove, Lulu serves the best brussel sprouts in Miami. Not to mention, the wake n’ bacon is a bloody mary made with BACON-INFUSED vodka.</p>

          <section id="whisk">
          <h2>Whisk</h2>

            <aside>

            </aside>

            <p class="description">Considering the parking lot is smaller than a Hecht dorm room, Whisk is a hidden gem. Located right by Sunset, Whisk can best be described as a gourmet-American-comfort food restaurant. The seating is almost as limited as the parking, but definitely worth the wait.</p>

          <h2>George's on Sunset</h2>

            </aside>

            <p class="description">It’s always a party at George’s on Sunset. With crazy sparklers and funky hats, George’s is an exciting place celebrate special occasions -- whether it be a birthday or your roommate finally dumping her lame boyfriend from home. Keep in mind, however, that people usually go for the experience and the opportunity for a dope instagram (#squadgoals)...not the food.</p>
